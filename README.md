# Melanoma Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks
> This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to accurately detect melanoma, a type of skin cancer. Early detection of melanoma is crucial, as it accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. This solution aims to assist dermatologists by automating the detection process, reducing the manual effort required in diagnosis.

## General Information
**Problem Statement**: Melanoma is one of the deadliest forms of skin cancer, and detecting it early can significantly reduce mortality rates. This project builds a CNN-based model that can evaluate images of skin lesions to detect the presence of melanoma.
**Objective**: The objective is to create a solution that assists dermatologists by automatically identifying melanoma in skin images. This can reduce the manual workload and provide quick, reliable results.
**Dataset**: The dataset used in this project consists of images of skin lesions. These images are labeled as either melanoma (positive for melanoma) or non-melanoma (benign or other skin conditions). The model is trained to classify these images accurately.
**Approach**: A CNN architecture is used for image classification, and data augmentation techniques like rotation, zoom, and flipping are applied to improve generalization and avoid overfitting.

## Conclusions
- The CNN-based model was able to classify images into melanoma and non-melanoma categories.
- Data augmentation has proven effective in improving the model's robustness by introducing variability in the training data.
- Despite the relatively low accuracy, the model lays the foundation for further improvements, such as hyperparameter tuning and more advanced architectures.
- Early-stage models like this can assist dermatologists in faster diagnoses, potentially saving lives by providing quicker results and reducing the need for manual analysis.
